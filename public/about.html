<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Edurinty Shashivadhan Reddy, an 18-year-old B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student at Manipal University Jaipur. I’m originally from Dhone, Andhra Pradesh.

As a first-year CSE student, I’m actively building my foundation in programming, problem-solving, and web technologies. I enjoy learning how technology works in real-world applications and continuously upskilling myself through hands-on practice and projects.

I’m motivated, curious, and eager to grow as a developer while exploring opportunities to apply my technical skills in practical and impactful ways.</p>
